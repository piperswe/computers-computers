  {"id":"hiranoDeclineThirdpartyVoting2007","abstract":"This paper documents and investigates a prominent but little discussed pattern in U.S. politics, which is the decline of third-party electoral support over the past century. We find evidence consistent with the claim that electoral support for third parties&#x2014;mainly left-wing third parties&#x2014;declined because the Democratic Party co-opted the left-wing policy position beginning with the passage of the New Deal agenda. We note first that most of the third-party voting in the pre-New-Deal era was for left-wing third parties and that this declined sharply during the 1930s and 1940s. We then show that after the New Deal the Democratic Party's electoral support was higher in areas that had traditionally supported left-wing third parties. Contrary to some claims in the literature, we find little support for the hypothesis that the decline of third-party voting was immediately due to electoral reforms such as the introduction of direct primaries and the Australian ballot, except possibly in the south.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,10]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Hirano","given":"Shigeo"},{"family":"Snyder","given":"James M."}],"citation-key":"hiranoDeclineThirdpartyVoting2007","container-title":"The Journal of Politics","DOI":"10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00490.x","ISSN":"00223816, 14682508","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"page":"1-16","publisher":"[The University of Chicago Press, Southern Political Science Association]","title":"The decline of third-party voting in the United States","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org.kidd.blinn.edu:2048/stable/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00490.x","volume":"69"},

  {"id":"thompsonLeftHistoryRevolution1997","abstract":"The political tradition loosely termed'the left'has been brought to crisis point as the twentieth century draws to a close. In this cohesive and wide-ranging study, Willie Thompson charts the history of the left, from its origins in the French Revolution to the present crisis. The schisms between revolution and reform which have so characterised the left and which have determined its shape as a world movement during the twentieth century, are described and analysed in detail. Thompson focuses on the principal currents, including the rise and fall of Bolshevism, Leninism and Stalinism; the embrace and subsequent abandonment of Marxist rhetoric by former Soviet allies in the Third World; European social democracy; and'actually existing socialism'in states such as China and Cuba. The impact of'alternatives'to the mainstream - Trotskyism, Maoism and Eurocommunism - is assessed, and the potential for the New Left and postwar social forces such as feminism, environmentalism and'identity'politics to facilitate renewal is evaluated. Thompson concludes that if the left is to play any part in addressing the unfinished agenda of the post-1990s, then it must develop a clear understanding of the historical lessons that follow from its earlier embodiments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,9]]},"archive":"eBook Collection (EBSCOhost)","author":[{"family":"Thompson","given":"Willie"}],"citation-key":"thompsonLeftHistoryRevolution1997","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-78371-944-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[1997]]},"language":"eng","number-of-pages":"263","publisher":"Pluto Press","publisher-place":"London","source":"eBook Collection (EBSCOhost)","title":"The left in history: revolution and reform in twentieth century politics","title-short":"The left in history","type":"book","URL":"http://kidd.blinn.edu:2048/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=56179&site=eds-live"},
