## The Tesla Model Three™

Some of you might know that for the duration of 2021, I owned a Tesla Model 3.

<!-- TODO photo -->

Specifically, it was a:

- 2021 Tesla Model 3
- Standard Range Plus
- Deep Blue Metallic Paint
- 18" Aero Wheels
- All Black Interior
- Full Self Driving Capability

When I bought it in late 2020, I paid $50,290.00. Today, a similarly specced
car would cost nearly $56,000.

Before taking delivery, whenever my boyfriend or I had a complaint with one of
our cars that would be solved with the new Tesla, I'd irritate him by
sarcastically going, "Well, with _The Tesla Model Three_, that isn't an issue."
That lead to me naming the car "The Tesla Model Three™️."

When I bought my Tesla, I was a tech person, and not a car person. The only two
car makes I was actually familiar with were Toyota, because multiple family
members have a history of running Toyota dealerships, and Tesla, because Teslas
are targeted towards tech people. A Tesla was the obvious choice for a car for
such a person, and if that still accurately described me I would still have my
Tesla. However, in the past year living with my boyfriend and his friends (his
two best friends are our housemates), I have definitely turned into a car
person.

As I begun to learn more and more about cars and other makes, I realized I
could do much better than Tesla. While the Tesla handled much better than any
car I had driven in the past, it was no true sports car. Performance-wise,
while it is fast, it isn't all that special for its price point. As for the
interior, the salesperson at BMW of West Houston put it perfectly - it feels
like a Kia. Now, that's not automatically a bad thing (because Hyundai/Kia is
perfectly capable of making beautiful interiors), but the general feeling of
that statement just _feels_ about right.

And then there's the build quality.

I was lucky. There were no glaring defects right out of the factory, so I was
able to take delivery with no hiccups. There was one thing I noticed after a
few weeks, a rubber piece that wasn't properly seated under the front hood, so
after a rock somehow cracked my panoramic sunroof I had the service center fix
that rubber piece while the car was in the shop for a sunroof replacement. That
was back when Teslas weren't as popular in Texas, and it was possible to get a
service center appointment and loaner in Houston.

A few months later, a whistle popped up. When cruising down the highway,
especially when it was windy, there would sometimes be a loud whistle that was
audible over just about every other noise - including the excessive wind and
road noise.

With a normal automaker, that wouldn't be that big of a deal. It's just a
matter of dropping by the dealership, having them work on it for an hour or two,
and getting the car back. If it ends up taking longer, the dealership will
give you a loaner to live your life with until the service is complete. With
Tesla, I had to deal with the service center situation.

I live in Brenham, a town about an hour west of Houston. There are two service
centers in Houston, North Houston and Westchase. With the recent explosion in
Tesla owners, both service centers are swamped with appointments, and with the
car shortage they aren't able to offer service loaners. So, if I want service,
I have to make an appointment months in advance, leave my car at the service
center, and have a friend drive me home (then back again when the service is
done). That's a terrible experience, so the whistle never got fixed.

## The Avalon

My mom is getting a new car soon - a 2019 Toyota Avalon Limited. I promise,
this is going somewhere.

<!-- TODO photo -->

She asked me to show her around all the gadgets and gizmos in the car, and I
was happy to do so. In doing that, I had a realization that my daily driver has
a worse interior than a _Toyota_. The most expensive Toyota sedan, but still. I
decided I want a proper luxury car.

I considered an SUV for a while, particularly the Toyota Venza Limited and
Mazda CX-5 Signature, but ultimately decided I want something fast and fun.
That's when I remembered the BMW i4.

## The i4

<!-- TODO photo -->

The BMW i4 is a sexy car. It's the only electric sporty car that doesn't try to
look space-age, and BMW deserves massive praise for it. At first glance, you
might think it's just a 4-series.

The i4 was the first BMW I really researched, back when it was announced. I'm
still a big fan of electric vehicles, so an i4 would be a great car for me.
It's bonus that it beats the Tesla Model 3 Performance in most ways. I got in
touch with BMW of West Houston, and it turns out if I want an i4, I'll be
waiting quite a while. That won't do, I'm impatient, impulsive, and want a new
car soon!

## The _Mazda CX-5_

I still went over to the dealership to check out what stock they had, and I
fell in love with one of the cars on the showroom floor. It's a 2022 BMW M340i -
the M Performance model of the 3-series, which many consider a better car than
the previous generation M3.

<!-- TODO photo -->

For those not familiar with BMW M's models, they have M Performance models,
with model numbers like Mxxxi (e.g. M340i, M550i, etc.), and true M models with
model numbers like Mx (e.g. M3, M5, etc.). M Performance models are really just
trims of the normal series they belong to, whereas M models are separate models,
where M is allowed to basically change whatever they want. Of course, M models
run quite a bit more expensive than M Performance models.

That first visit, I didn't give it a test drive. My boyfriend and I just sat in
it and thoroughly enjoyed the interior, especially compared to the Tesla. We
left to go to dinner, and I tried and failed to convince my boyfriend to go
back to the dealership and buy the car right when we were done.

I did convince him to come back with me the next day, however.

That day, we took a test drive. Halfway through, we switched seats and he drove
it. The whole time, there was a grin on both of our faces that hadn't been seen
since I first drove a Tesla. This was the car.

It was a bit of an upgrade price-wise, with an MSRP of about $59,000, but it
was 100% worth it. Of course, I'm a sucker and bought some extra insurance
packages (like tire & rim, windshield, paint, prepaid maintenance, etc.), but
given how expensive BMW repairs are and the fact that most of them are
cancellable for a prorated refund, I'm not going to lose sleep over that.
Overall, including the sales tax I had to pay on the difference between my
trade-in and the new car, my purchase came out to about $65,000. It's the
biggest purchase I've ever made, but I suspect I'm not going to regret it.

We decided to see how long it would take for our housemates to notice I got a
new car, so when they asked where we were, we just said we were checking out a
Mazda CX-5. We regularly go to car dealerships and take test drives (it's our
idea of a fun afternoon), so they didn't bat an eye.

I got all the paperwork filled out, talked with an interesting, eccentric
finance manager, transferred my belongings from the Tesla to the BMW, and said
goodbye to the Tesla for the last time.

We went out to eat, then drove home. I can't exactly say I followed the speed
limit... but then again, this was US-290 - nobody follows the speed limit. The
BMW handled itself so much better than the Tesla ever did all the way up to...
whatever speed I went (which was definitely less than the speed limit), and it
didn't feel like it was going so fast (in a good way - it still felt fast!).

When we got home, our housemates immediately noticed (because of course they
would - why wouldn't they?), and I decided to jokingly name the car the
_Mazda CX-5_. My last car's name was an inside joke after all, so this one
should be too.

So, that's the story of the _Mazda CX-5_ so far. Farewell Tesla, I sincerely
hope you improve your customer experience, because there are many like me that
will take a similar route.
