## ðŸ‘‹

Hello there!

I'm Piper (she/they), a software engineer by trade, computer tinkerer &
entrepreneur by hobby, and master of sprouting strange new interests. I usually
use this blog to write about things I've done that seem somewhat noteworthy,
but sometimes other topics might find their way in here.

## What do I do for fun?

My persistent interests tend to be related to one of these broad topics:

- Programming
- Mathematics
- Computer Networking
- Data Hoarding

Currently, there are a few technologies that really have my interest:

- The [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language
- The Nix package manager and [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) operating system
- The [Datomic](https://www.datomic.com/) database
- The art of [data hoarding](https://www.reddit.com/r/datahoarder)
- Home networking, though my home network has probably progressed far beyond
  what one would typically put under "home networking."

## What do I do for work?

I currently work as a systems engineer for [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/).
On my free time, I work on projects for [Lutris](https://lutris.engineering/),
my engineering firm.

## Where else can you find my writing?

I'm still working on finding some of my old writing that I'm proud of and
moving it over to this blog. Here's a collection of some of my writing that's
still available across the web.

- [Demoing Web Applications with Firefox Containers](https://ladderlife.github.io/blog/2020/02/demo-firefox-containers/)
  on the [Ladder Engineering Blog](https://ladderlife.github.io/blog/)

## What's the tech behind this blog?

This blog is actually hosted in my utility room closet! I have gigabit internet
at home, so I figured I might as well just run my personal blog from home. It's
a Hugo static site built using Nix and served up using Nginx on NixOS, and
connected to the outside world through a [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/),
meaning I don't need to worry about NAT, port forwarding, DDoSes, or anything
else of the sort.

## Who made that profile picture?

I commissioned it from Nathan Butler
([@xXacidnekoXx](https://twitter.com/xXacidnekoXx) on Twitter - fair warning,
he posts some not-safe-for-work content) a while back!

## How can you contact me?

If you'd like to get in touch with me, send me an email to any address at this
domain (piperswe.me). They all go straight to my inbox.
